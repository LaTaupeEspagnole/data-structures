This is my first article on an important project for me : transmiting basics of
algorithmics and programming using C. Data structures and algorithms are major
in computer science and helps understanding programming languages. Knowing the
pros and cons of the basic data structures makes you able te build more
complicated data structures that fit best your needs. C is in my opinion the
best language to do that learning. No hidden code and a simple syntaxe, c lets
you build your code in a clear and portable way. You will be able to understand
every thing you write.

### What will be explained in this project ?
* Table
  * Searching Algorithms
  * Sorting Algoriths
* Stack
* Queue
* List
  * Searching Algorithms
  * Sorting Algorithms
* Binary Tree
  * Filling Algorithms
  * Searching Algorithms
  * Sorting Algorithms
* Hash Table
  * Hash Set
  * Hash Map

*This list is presented as an indication of what will be explained, but for
pedagogical reasons it will not be in this perticular order. The list may be
modified or expand as I make theses articles.*

As I write theses articles I will edit this first one to add the links in the
list above. More generally all articles are ment to be updated frequentlly to
incorporate the feedbacks people make or adapte the pedagogy.

This project is made to be started at any time and still be up to date. For
that reson all and every source of this project will be grouped in a single Git
repository. Any one will be able to propose changes over the course. The
processe of commiting updates will be specified on an other article.
