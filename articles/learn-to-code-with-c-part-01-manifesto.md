## What is the goal of the project ?

### To whom it is addressed ?

**This project is made for anyone** who want's to learn about basic algorithmic
and programming. If you are a **first year student in a computer science
school** or preparing for it this project is also made for you.

If you are a school teacher and want to use my work are welcome, juste be sure
to respect the **license** of the project which is in the LICENSE.txt at the root
of this project and on [this](/articles/data-structures/LICENSE.html) page.

### What I have in mind while writing this project ?

Learning should be as easy as possible, you need to be presented the subject in
a clear and simple way. Once you understand and feel the mechanisms involved at
a certain level of complexity, you can understant the next level with minimal
effort. It is with these two concepts in mine that I wrote all the project. The
code is ment to be straight forward and the explanations are made to be easy to
understand. **Using graphics and short explanations folowed with examples from
different points of view is my goal when writing code, documentation and
articles.**

If you want to contribut to the project you need to have the above paragraphe
in mind. On the next sections are the technical explanations on how to
participate in the project.


## How can I help ?

You are welcome to participate in the project through many ways and I explan
below what they are.

### Submit patches

One way of contributing is by submiting paches to me. If you find typos,
optimisations in the code or a better way to explaine something, I will be
glad to incorporate it in the project. Bear in mind that when I talk about
optimisations I am not only talking about speed or memory optimisations.
Indeed simplifying code is an optimisations in my opinion.

**The way of submiting √† patch :** Since I am using Github to host the project
I will use the **Github pull request** method for patching things. It is a pretty
straight forward way of patching one or multiple files in a git repository. And
also it is easy for you to use so the gap between seeing a typo/bug and
patching it is short.

If you dont know how to make a pull request I recommend you checking out this
video : [Creating a Simple Github Pull Request -  Jake Vanderplas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgbCcBNZcdQ).

After your pull request is posted, I will analyse it and if it is justified and
follows the rules of the manifesto I will add it to the project.
