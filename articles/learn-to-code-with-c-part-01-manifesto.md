## What is the goal of the project ?

### To whom it is addressed ?

**This project is made for anyone** who want's to learn about basic algorithmic
and programming. If you are a **first year student in a computer science
school** or preparing for it this project is also made for you.

If you are a school teacher and want to use my work are welcome, juste be sure
to respect the license of the project which is in the LICENSE.txt at the root
of this project and on [this](/articles/data-structures/LICENSE.html) page.

### What I have in mind while writing this project ?

Learning should be as easy as possible, you need to be presented the subject in
a clear and simple way. Once you understand and feel the mechanisms involved at
a certain level of complexity, you can understant the next level with minimal
effort. It is with these two concepts in mine that I wrote all the project. The
code is ment to be straight forward and the explanations are made to be easy to
understand. Using graphics and short explanations folowed with examples from
different points of view is my goal when writing code, documentation and
articles.
